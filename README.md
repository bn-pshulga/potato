# üõ†Ô∏è Error Logging Service Architecture (Inspired by Sentry.io)

## ‚ùì Developer Questions for the Platform Owner

1.Given our budget constraints, is it more efficient to use an existing solution like Sentry rather than building a custom error logging platform from scratch?

üß† Note:
Best code is no code!

### General Product Scope

1. What platforms should the SDKs support?
3. Are attachments (e.g., logs, screenshots) required?

### Storage & Retention

1. Should users be able to export logs (CSV, JSON)?
2. Are custom log levels needed?

### Alerting

1. What alert types and thresholds should be configurable?
2. Which integrations should be supported at launch?
3. Should users be able to define custom alert rules?

### Security & Compliance

1. Is SSO or OAuth support required?
2. How should API key management be handled?
3. Are there any compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, SOC2)?

### Tech Inspiration:

* **Sentry SDKs** (open-source) are modular, efficient, and pluggable.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Client SDKs

**Purpose:**  
Allow applications to capture and send error logs and context data to the server.

**Supported Platforms:**

- **Web:** JavaScript, React, Vue, Angular
- **Mobile:** Swift, Kotlin, React Native, Flutter
- **Backend:** Python, Node.js, Go, Java, Ruby

**Features:**

- DSN-based configuration
- Automatic and manual error capturing
- Sampling and rate limiting
- Async transport (HTTP, gRPC)
- Extensible middleware

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Event Queue (Redis Streams)

**Purpose:**  
Buffer and decouple the ingestion of logs from their processing.

**Why Redis Streams?**

- Easy to deploy and scale
- Built-in support for consumer groups
- Reliable message delivery
- Better suited for small to mid-scale systems than Kafka

**Event Types:**

- Errors
- Performance traces (optional)
- Attachments (e.g., logs, screenshots)

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Event Processor (Workers)

**Purpose:**  
Asynchronously process events from the queue and prepare them for storage.

**Technology Stack:**

- **Redis** ‚Äì used for both queuing and caching

**Responsibilities:**

- Normalize stack traces and payloads
- Group errors via fingerprinting
- Add user, environment, and version context
- Store processed logs in PostgreSQL
- Trigger alerting logic

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Storage (PostgreSQL)

**Purpose:**  
Serve as the unified database for logs and system metadata.

**Structure:**

- Use `JSONB` columns for flexible event storage
- Index on key fields (`timestamp`, `level`, `project_id`)
- Partition by time for scalable retention
- Foreign keys for metadata: users, projects, teams

**Benefits:**

- Easy to query with SQL
- Good performance for moderate data volumes
- Strong consistency guarantees

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Web Dashboard

**Purpose:**  
Provide users with a UI to view, search, and manage errors.

**Frontend:** React + TypeScript  
**Backend:** NestJS (TypeScript) with REST or GraphQL

**Features:**

- Issue list and error details
- Stack trace viewer
- Tag filtering (release, environment, user)
- Project and team settings
- Role-based access control (RBAC) using guards and decorators
- Real-time updates using WebSockets (via @nestjs/websockets)
- API authentication (JWT, API keys, OAuth)
- Throttling and rate limiting (@nestjs/throttler)
- Integration with Redis for caching or pub/sub

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Alerts & Integrations

**Alert Conditions:**

- New issue
- Regression of resolved issues

**Tech Stack:**

- PostgreSQL-based rule engine

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ DevOps & Infrastructure

**Deployment:**

- Docker + Kubernetes
- Helm charts for orchestration
- Horizontal scaling of API and workers

**Monitoring:**

- Prometheus + Grafana for metrics
- ELK Stack or Loki for logs

**CI/CD:**

- GitHub Actions or GitLab CI
- Docker image pipelines
- Auto-deploy to staging/production

**Security:**

- HTTPS enforced
- API authentication via DSN or JWT
- Role-based access control
- Secrets via Vault or AWS Secrets Manager
